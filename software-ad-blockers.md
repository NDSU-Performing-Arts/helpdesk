# Installing Ad Blocking Plugins
In response to faculty interest in blocking youtube ads for classroom use, we are providing the following instructions. *Note: some sources consider the use of ad-blocking software to bypass YouTube advertising to be copyright infringement. Use of this software is at your own discretion and risk*

## Instructions
Ad Blocking plugins are installed on a per-browser basis. You will need to install this software on each classroom computer you teach with, and on every browser you use on each of those computers. It is likely you will need to install these plugins at the beginning of every semester.

Install one of these browser extensions (it is not necessary to install multiple extensions). You will usually be prompted to click a button labeled as "Get" or "Install."
