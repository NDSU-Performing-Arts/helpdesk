# NDSU vs NDUS Accounts
NDSU Students have two accounts: **NDSU** accounts which are university-specific, and ***NDUS*** accounts which are used for things that cover the entire 11-campus North Dakota University System.

Your **NDSU** and ***NDUS*** usernames will be the same, but your passwords may be different.

**NDSU** account login pages usually look like this: (it usually says “NDSU” on it)

**NDSU** Accounts are used for:

1. Logging into computers (office and computer lab computers)
2. Library services
3. Wireless Networks (Eduroam, use your @**ndsu**.edu email as username)
4. Navigate
5. Blackboard Activation Manager
6. Track Training
7. Other things that use this login screen.

***NDUS*** account login pages usually look like this: (it usually has the ***NDUS*** triangle on it)

***NDUS*** Accounts are used for:

1. Email (see note below)(shortcut to email: [https://outlook.com/ndus.edu](https://outlook.com/ndus.edu))
2. Blackboard
3. Campus Connection (student/instructor management at [https://studentadmin.connectnd.us](https://studentadmin.connectnd.us/))
4. HRMS (employee management)
5. Other things that use this login screen

Note about email: You log into your email account with your ***NDUS*** password, but your email address is (very likely) @**ndsu**.edu. This is weird, but this is correct. You actually have two email addresses, [yourname@**ndsu**.edu](mailto:yourname@ndsu.edu) AND [yourname@***ndus***.edu](mailto:yourname@ndus.edu). Mail sent to either one will show up in your inbox. When you send email, it will show your @**ndsu** address.

If you’re affiliated with another ***NDUS*** institution, your email may be even weirder.
